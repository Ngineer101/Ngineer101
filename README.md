## Hey, I'm Nico ðŸ‘‹

### Engineering lead and full-stack software engineer

Iâ€™m a full-stack product engineer and engineering leader with 8+ years of experience building and
scaling customer-facing applications across web, mobile, and microservices. Iâ€™m passionate about developer productivity, building software with
measurable product outcomes, and generative AI.

Currently, I'm leading a team of 9 software engineers at [Swapfiets](https://swapfiets.nl/en-NL).

In my free time, I'm hacking on a few side projects:

- [TurboForm](https://github.com/turboform) - Generate forms with AI - open-source Typeform alternative
- [Supermeme.ai](https://supermeme.ai) - Generate memes with AI
