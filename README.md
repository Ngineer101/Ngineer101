## Hey, I'm Nico 👋

### Engineering lead and full-stack software engineer

I’m a full-stack product engineer and engineering leader with 10+ years of experience building and
scaling customer-facing applications across web, mobile, and microservices. I’m passionate about developer productivity, building software with
measurable product outcomes, and generative AI.

Currently, I'm a lead engineer at [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) working on improving the user activation and engagement on the platform.

In my free time, I'm hacking on a few side projects:

- [Supermeme.ai](https://supermeme.ai) - Generate memes with AI
- [Turbodoc](https://github.com/turbodoc-org) - Cross-platform bookmark manager
